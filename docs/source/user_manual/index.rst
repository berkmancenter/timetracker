Time entries
============

* Users can create, edit, remove their time entries.
* Required fields for time entries: ``Date``, ``Time spent``.

====================

TimeTracker offers two user roles: ``user`` and ``admin``.

Users can:

* Create, edit, and remove time entries they've created.
* Manage the timesheets they've created.

Admins can:

* Perform all functions available to regular users.
